# Oh My Posh in Windows Powershell
[Oh My Posh](https://ohmyposh.dev) is a prompt theme engine for any shell. In this repository I keep my profile that configures it. It helps me to understand better where and what I am doing while working in PowerShell. Simillar to Oh My ZSH in linux. 
Documentation on how to use it is available at the project website: https://ohmyposh.dev
