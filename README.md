# Oh My Posh in Windows Powershell
[Oh My Posh](https://ohmyposh.dev) is *a prompt theme engine for any shell*. In this repository I keep my profile that configures it. The configuration helps me to better understand in which folder I am working.  And what I am exactly doing. It simillar to Oh My ZSH in linux. 
Documentation on how to use it is available at the project website: https://ohmyposh.dev

The profile is based on the [clean-detailed](https://ohmyposh.dev/docs/themes#clean-detailed) theme.
